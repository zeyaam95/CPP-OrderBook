### Class Notes:

Use templates for your structure. Ovverride operators for Bid and Order classes.  
Bid book and Ask book have different priorities, use one Order Object and have child Bid and Ask objects.  
The data members: Account Number, Price and Quantity remain the same.  
Use ">=" operator in the container class.  
The reason for using time delay is for timestamping, so we can avoid duplicates.  
Compare the Bid Book front with the Ask Book front.
